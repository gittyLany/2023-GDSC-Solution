Puns are the ultimate dad joke weapon.
They're the kind of
wordplay that will
make your friends groan and
roll their eyes but
secretly love you for it.
Whether you're a master of puns
or just starting out,
there's no denying the fun and hilarity
that comes with a clever play on words.
For example,
"I told my wife she was
drawing her eyebrows too high.
She looked surprised."
Or how about the one about the guy
who lost his left arm
and leg in a car crash?
Don't worry, he's all right now.
Puns aren't for everyone,
but for those who appreciate a witty quip,
they're the perfect way to
lighten the mood and make everyone smile.
So go ahead,
embrace your inner dad
and let the puns fly.
Your friends might groan,
but deep down they'll love you for it.
