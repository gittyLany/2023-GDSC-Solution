Math is like a box of chocolates
you never know
what you're going to get!
Unless, of course,
you're really good at math,
in which case you probably
know exactly what you're going to get.
But for the rest of us,
math can be a real rollercoaster.
One minute you're breezing
through a problem like it's nothing,
and the next minute
you're staring at a page of numbers
like they're written
in an alien language.
And don't even get
me started on algebra.
Who came up with that anyways?
Mixing numbers and letters
should be a crime
punishable by detention.
But despite all of its challenges,
math can be pretty fun,
especially when you finally
solve that impossible problem and
feel like a genius for five minutes.
So keep your calculators handy and
your sense of humor intact
it's going to be a wild ride!
