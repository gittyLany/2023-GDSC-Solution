Are we there yet?
Ah, that timeless question
that echoes through
family cars everywhere.
It's the soundtrack of
road trips and the
anthem of impatient
backseat passengers.
But fear not, fellow travelers,
for I have the answer you seek:
No. We are not there yet.
But don't worry,
we'll get there eventually.
In the meantime,
feel free to enjoy the scenic route,
sing some car karaoke,
or count license plates
from different states.
And just remember,
the journey is half the fun...
or at least that's
what we tell ourselves
to make the next
few hours go by a little faster.
