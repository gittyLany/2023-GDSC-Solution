School, oh school.
The place where we go
to learn the Pythagorean theorem and
the capital of Uzbekistan.
It's also the place where
we pretend to listen to the teacher
while we secretly write
notes to our friends about the latest drama.
And who could forget
about the groans we let out
when we get assigned
an essay or a project?
But let's not forget
the best part about school:
the cafeteria food.
Nothing beats a sloppy joe
and a carton of chocolate milk.
Overall, school may have
its ups and downs,
but at least it provides us
with some unforgettable memories and
a never-ending supply of No.2 pencils.
