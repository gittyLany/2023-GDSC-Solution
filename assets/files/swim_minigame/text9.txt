What does the fox say?
Well, according to the
viral YouTube video,
the answer is
"Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!"
and "Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!"
Who knew that foxes
were such lyrical geniuses?
While we may never
know for sure what sounds
a fox actually makes,
one thing is for certain:
this catchy tune is sure
to get stuck in your head.
So the next time you see
a furry little fox scurrying
across your yard,
just remember,
he's probably
singing his heart out
with a melody
that we mere humans
just can't comprehend.
