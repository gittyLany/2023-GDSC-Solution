Just keep swimming!
These three little
words have become iconic,
thanks to a certain forgetful fish,
and they are a
great reminder for all of us
when we feel like
we're in over our heads.
Whether you're
facing a tough challenge
at work or in your personal life,
just keep swimming
can serve as a mantra
to help you push
through the rough patches.
And if all else fails,
take a cue from the blue fish
and just start singing
"just keep swimming,
just keep swimming"
it might not solve your problems,
but it's sure to
put a smile on your face!
So, remember
when in doubt, just keep swimming!
