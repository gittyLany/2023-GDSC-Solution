Turtles may be slow,
but they definitely
know how to have a good time.
Just watch them sunbathing on a log,
giving each other
high-fives with
their little flippers,
and you'll see what I mean.
And let's not forget
about their fancy shells
talk about stylish!
Turtles also have
a great sense of humor,
as evidenced by their
ability to stick their heads in
and out of their shells as if
they're playing a game of peek-a-boo.
Plus, they're always
up for a good race,
even if it takes them
a bit longer to cross the finish line
than their faster animal counterparts.
So here's to you, turtles
slow and steady wins the race,
but it's also important
to take time to stop and
smell the roses (or the pond water).
