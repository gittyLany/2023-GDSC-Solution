Let it go, let it go!
Sorry, I couldn't resist
belting out a line
from that catchy song.
But in all seriousness,
"let it go" is a
great piece of advice
that we could all benefit from.
Whether it's a grudge,
a mistake, or a bad haircut,
there comes a time
when we just need
to let things go and move on.
Holding onto negative
emotions or experiences
can be like wearing
a backpack full of rocks
it weighs us down and
makes it harder to enjoy life.
So next time you're
feeling bogged down by something,
just take a deep breath
and let it go.
And if all else fails,
just sing that Frozen song
at the top of your lungs
that always seems to help!
