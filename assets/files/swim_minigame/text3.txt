Potatoes. They're just like us.
They come in all shapes and sizes
have different personalities,
and they even have their own
fries-tyle (see what I did there?).
Some potatoes are mashed up
and mixed with butter,
while others are baked
and topped with
all kinds of deliciousness.
Let's not forget sweet potatoes,
who are always trying
to steal the spotlight
with their orangey glow.
But no matter how you slice it,
potatoes are definitely
one of the most versatile foods out there.
They can be fancy
or they can be down-to-earth,
but one thing is for sure
they always bring
a certain je ne sais spud to the table.
